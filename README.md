# Pre-work-study-guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work

A structured website for the Prework Stugy Guide that holds the notes I take throughout prework so that, as a boot camp student, I will have all of my notes in one place. Topics covered includes HTML, CSS, GIT & JavaScript

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
